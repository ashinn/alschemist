Ah, I finally figured out the problem!  The linker had been giving me the
following warning:

ld: warning: i386 architecture of input file `pusha.o' is incompatible
with i386:x86-64 output

but I've written some fairly complex programs without any problems, so
I figured it didn't mean anything.  It turns out that this *is* a problem, =
and
for a few opcodes (like PUSHA and memory movements to/from EAX),
you need to pass the -melf_i386 to ld.  Why just these and not other
opcodes, I have no idea.
