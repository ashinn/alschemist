New in Version 0.3
==================

* new api procedure:
  sassy-reloc-target-section sassy-reloc -> section
  returns the name of the section in which the relocation was defined

* nested section directives are allowed

* added 'dont-expand option to skip macro expansion

* added (bytes ...), (words ...), (dwords ...) forms for outputting
  raw bytes into a test section

* added mov instructions to and from test registers (TR3-7)

New in Version 0.2
==================

* 16 bit support using 32-bit addressing syntax

* New form: Local labels support/declarations
  (locals (<label-name> ...) <item> ...)

* Syntax change: all label definitions are now written
  (label <name> <item> ...)

  replaced by "begin". "begin" is now usable in data and heap
  directives.

* Support for Guile 1.8

* Support for Scheme48 module interfaces

* sassy-mode minor Emacs mode (sassy.el)

* Segment Override prefixes and branch hinting prefixes

* Better handling of default operand sizes, optimizing generated code
  sequences for size.

* New version of sassy-make-bin (includes a data section now)

* Fixes for with-win with-lose with-win-lose, so that writing assembly
  in a, umm, "natural" cps style is possible.

* Numerous bug fixes, clean-ups, and more error checks.
