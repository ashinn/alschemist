; This is a minor mode extension to scheme-mode called sassy-mode It
; only provides some additional syntax highlighting and indentation
; for sassy keywords.  Files suffixed with a ".sassy" extension will
; autoload this mode
;
;
; INSTALLATION
; ============
;
; 1) Put this file in the appropriate place
;    (someplace in your emacs's load-path).
;    (For help with load-paths do:  M-x apropos load-path
;
; 2) Add the following two lines to your .emacs file, and uncomment them
;    there
;
;    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.sassy$" . sassy-mode))
;    (autoload 'sassy-mode "sassy" "Minor mode for editing Sassy files" t)
;
; 3) Start up yo 'macs
;
; All files that end with the extension ".sassy" will activate this
; minor mode. Since it's built on top of scheme-mode any scheme code
; will still highlight as well.
